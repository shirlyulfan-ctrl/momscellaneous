Welcome to Momscellaneous (“**Momscellaneous**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”). These Terms & Conditions (“**Terms**”) govern your access to and use of the Momscellaneous website, mobile experiences, and related services (collectively, the “**Platform**”).

By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

## 1. What Momscellaneous Is (and Is Not)
Momscellaneous is a **marketplace platform** that enables individuals and families (“**Customers**”) to find and connect with independent service providers (“**Providers**”) for services such as childcare, tutoring, pet care, household help, and other tasks (the “**Services**”).

**Momscellaneous does not provide Services.** We do not employ Providers, do not supervise Services, and do not control how Services are performed. Any agreement for Services is solely between the Customer and the Provider.

## 3. No Background Checks / No Screening Guarantee
**Momscellaneous does not perform background checks, criminal checks, sex offender registry checks, driving record checks, reference checks, or identity verification** unless we expressly state otherwise in writing.

Customers are **strongly encouraged** to conduct their own independent screening, including interviews, reference checks, identity verification, and background checks where appropriate, before engaging a Provider.

## 4. Independent Providers (No Employment Relationship)

**All payments are subject to Stripe’s terms** and payment network rules. We are not responsible for errors or interruptions caused by payment networks or Stripe.
